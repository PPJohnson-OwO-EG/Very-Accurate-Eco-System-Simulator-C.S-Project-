# Very-Accurate-Eco-System-Simulator      C.S-Project
It's a very accurate simulation of an eco-system! It contains many options for you tweak around and is actually pretty deep and random.

This is my first proper 'big' project in Python so if it's scuffed that's why.


I would reccommend launching this program by right clicking on it and opening with Python 3.12, if you don't have Python then you should install that first. YOU MUST INSTALL COLORAMA TO RUN THIS FILE!!!!!!!

This place also stores old versions of the game for you to peek through if you so wish.

Suggestions are welcome!
